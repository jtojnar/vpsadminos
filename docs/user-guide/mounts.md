# Mounts

It is possible to mount directories from the host to containers. What makes this
complicated are [user namespaces](../containers/user-namespaces.md). If the
containers are to have access to directories and files in the mountpoint, you
need to change their ownership to match the container's user namespace. Sharing
data between containers in different user namespaces is not possible, as they
do not have access to each other's user and group IDs and appear as owned
by nobody/nogroup.

## Changing ownerships
Let's prepare a shared directory for containers using the same user namespace:

```bash
# Create a user
osctl user new --map 0:888000:65536 shareduserns

# Create a container
osctl ct new --user shareduserns --distribution ubuntu myct01

# Prepare directory
mkdir -p /var/shared

# Create some test files
cd /var/shared
mkdir dir1 dir2
touch file1 file2 dir1/file dir2/file
```

Now we can bind-mount this directory to one or more containers:

```bash
osctl ct mounts new \
                    --fs /var/shared \
                    --type bind \
                    --opts bind,rw,create=dir \
                    --mountpoint /mnt/shared \
                    myct01
```

When you attempt to access those files from the container, you will not have
permission:

```bash
osctl ct attach myct01

root@myct01:/# ls -l /mnt/shared/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 60 Jan 10 10:45 dir1
drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 60 Jan 10 10:45 dir2
-rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup  0 Jan 10 10:45 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup  0 Jan 10 10:45 file2

root@myct01:/# echo yay > /mnt/shared/file1 
bash: /mnt/shared/file1: Permission denied
```

As you can see, because the files are not in the container's user namespace,
it has no access. The files need to be chowned into the user namespace. Since
the user we created has user/group IDs shifted by `888000`, if we chown the
files to `888000:888000`, they will appear to be owned as root in the container.

```bash
chown -R 888000:888000 /var/shared

osctl ct attach myct01

root@myct01:/# ls -l /mnt/shared/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 60 Jan 10 10:45 dir1
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 60 Jan 10 10:45 dir2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Jan 10 10:45 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Jan 10 10:45 file2

root@myct01:/# echo yay > /mnt/shared/file1
root@myct01:/# cat /mnt/shared/file1
yay
```

## ZFS UID/GID mapping
Changing ownership of all files and directories to share can take a long time,
depending on how many files you have. In fact, the same rules apply for the
container's rootfs. To avoid chowning files altogether, we patched our ZFS
to handle UID/GID mapping at runtime. Let's prepare a shared dataset for the
same user and container as above.

```bash
zfs create tank/shared
```

To enable UID/GID mapping, you can set `uidmap` and `gidmap` properties.
Set both properties to map user/group IDs based on the *osctl*'s user
configuration:

```bash
zfs unmount tank/shared
zfs set uidmap="0:888000:666000" gidmap="0:888000:65536" tank/shared
zfs mount tank/shared
```

The format for `uidmap` and `gidmap` properties is:
`<uid within user namespace>:<uid as seen on the host>:<number of mapped ids>`.
Multiple mappings can be separated by a comma.

Now, prepare some test files:

```bash
cd /tank/shared
mkdir dir1 dir2
touch file1 file2 dir1/file dir2/file
```

Bind-mount the dataset into the container:

```bash
osctl ct mounts new \
                    --fs /tank/shared \
                    --type bind \
                    --opts bind,rw,create=dir \
                    --mountpoint /mnt/shared \
                    myct01
```

And the container has access to those files immediately:

```bash
osctl ct attach myct01

root@myct01:/# ls -l /tank/shared/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 60 Jan 10 10:45 dir1
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 60 Jan 10 10:45 dir2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Jan 10 10:45 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Jan 10 10:45 file2

root@myct01:/# echo yay > /tank/shared/file1
root@myct01:/# cat /mnt/shared/file1
yay
```

The UID/GID mapping can be changed without any cost, except that the dataset has
to be remounted. ZFS does not store mapped UIDs/GIDs on disk, the shifting
happens at runtime, based on the properties. If you send/receive the dataset
elsewhere, UIDs/GIDs will not be shifted, unless you set `uidmap`/`gidmap`
properties on the target dataset as well.
